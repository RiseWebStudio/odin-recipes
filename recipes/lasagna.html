    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna has long been a dinner table classic, not only in Italy or in the United States, but in many countries
        around the world. It is layers of pasta with delicate sauce, meat and cheese that come together to form a real
        explosion of rich flavor. Making lasagna takes some effort and time, but it's well worth it because you end up
        with an unbeatable meal for a large family or group of friends.</p>

    <p>As with many Italian dishes whose origins go back centuries, lasagna was different centuries ago than it is
        today, evolving and acquiring several variations. As much as we associate lasagna with Italy, the word itself
        comes from ancient Greece. It first sounded like laganon, which were flat sheets of pasta dough in a rectangular
        or square shape, baked or fried over a fire. The traditional lasagna alla bolognese is the first dish,
        consisting of layers of thin pasta dough made from flour, eggs, and spinach; between each layer is a stew of
        meat and vegetables and béchamel sauce. The top layer is lightly sprinkled with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; the
        filling is then baked. Tomatoes appeared in the recipe later. But it's worth noting that some researchers in
        Britain have found a cookbook with a lasagna recipe that dates back to the 1390s, laying claim to the first
        lasagna. To summarize, the name can be traced back to ancient Greece, the first mention of the recipe to Britain
        and the long perfection of the dish to Italy. Regardless of who can claim the glory of lasagna's creation, it is
        simply wonderful that it has reached our table through the centuries!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the basics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>800-900g of veal mince (or mixed mince)</li>
        <li>1 cup of tomato juice (or tomato sauce to taste)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 stalks of celery</li>
        <li>100ml of red dry wine</li>
        <li>300g of hard cheese</li>
        <li>70g of parmesan</li>
        <li>15-16 lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>3 sprigs of basil for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the béchamel sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>800 ml-1 liter of milk</li>
        <li>80-100 g of butter (+ 20 g for greasing the pan)</li>
        <li>80-100 g of flour</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground nutmeg (or grated)</li>
        <li>1-2 pinches of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on the oven to preheat to 180 degrees. To do this, you first need to prepare roux - this is the base of
            béchamel sauce, as well as other sauces, soups or main dishes, which is made from flour and a fatty
            component. There are two ways to prepare such a base. The first way is to melt 80-100g of butter in a pan or
            in a saucepan, add the same amount of flour, and fry everything together for three minutes, as most home
            cooks do around the world. This method is quite easy to do. Or you can try your hand at another option. To
            do this, first brown the flour in a dry saucepan with constant stirring for 1 minute, until the
            characteristic nutty flavor appears and the flour is slightly golden. Then add the butter, and stir
            everything vigorously with a whisk until smooth and mushy. The second method may give more flavor to your
            sauce, but there is a chance that through inexperience you may have the flour burn. So it's up to you to
            choose the option.</li>
        <li>The base of the sauce is ready and now you can move on to the next step. Pour in 0.8-1 liters of cold milk
            in a thin stream, stirring constantly to avoid the formation of lumps. It is very important to stir the
            sauce intensely with a whisk at this stage.</li>
        <li>Boil the sauce, stirring constantly over medium heat with a whisk until it thickens to a creamy consistency.
            Add a little salt to taste and ¼ tsp. ground nutmeg and stir. If you have fresh nuts, grate them on a fine
            grater. The béchamel sauce is ready. Set it aside until we begin to assemble the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Now prepare the bolognese sauce, the meat component of our lasagna. Cut the onion and 3 cloves of garlic
            into small cubes. Heat a pan with 3 Tbsp of olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic for a few minutes until
            the onion is soft.</li>
        <li>Peel celery stalks (2 pcs.) from coarse fibers and cut into thin slices. Add to the pan with the onions and
            fry all together for 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Then add 800-900g of minced meat and, while constantly stirring with a wooden spatula, break it up into
            small pieces. It should cook evenly and darken. Add 100 ml of red wine and steam for 5 minutes. The wine
            will give the sauce an incredible noble aroma and flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 cup of tomato juice and stew the mixture for another 5-10 minutes to allow the sauce to evaporate
            by half. You can use tomato sauce, homemade or store-bought instead of tomato juice. Taste and season with
            salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Grate 300g of cheese on a coarse grater and start assembling the lasagne. Choose a rectangular ceramic
            baking dish. Grease the dish with 20g of butter. Spread a small amount of béchamel sauce on the bottom of
            the dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sheets of lasagne (you will need 15-16 sheets in total) so that they cover the bottom of the
            dish as much as possible. It's okay if you have to overlap them a bit.</li>
        <li>Spread a third of the bolognese sauce evenly over the lasagna sheets, using a spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Now add a small amount of béchamel sauce. Try to spread it evenly around the perimeter of the mold.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a third of the grated hard cheese, so that it spreads evenly over the mold as well.</li>
        <li>Cover with lasagna sheets and repeat the assembly procedure 2-3 times, depending on the height of the mold.
            I ended up with three full layers of bolognese sauce. Sprinkle the last layer of lasagne sheets with
            béchamel milk sauce and sprinkle it with 70g of finely grated Parmesan. Put the dish in a 180-degree oven
            for 40-50 minutes until it is nicely browned. I baked it on lower heat for 30 minutes, then switched to
            higher and lower heat for a golden crust. Take the hot lasagna out of the oven and let it rest for 15
            minutes, then slice into portions and serve with basil leaves and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
